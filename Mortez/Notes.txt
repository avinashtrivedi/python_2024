I have two NC files, the first one is historical land cover change from 1850 to 2014. I need only the last time step of this file to use as my current land cover (2014).
Another file is a map of sustainable forest cover that we want toreach after 55 years (2069).
The changes should be applied on 2014 map gradually to reach the second map, but the changes should be proportional to the current land cover types.
- in the historical file we have 9 types(lev) of land cover. Here are the categouries for each:
Forest area: levels 1-5
crop area: levels 6-7
grass area: levels 8-9

So, the idea is that increase forest area in the current map gradullay to reach the second forest area map by 55 years,
this increase have to proportional to each type of land cover. Forexample if we have 10 perecnt of type1 and 20 percent of type2, t
the increase should be 10% increase for the first type and 20% for the second type. 
In addition, I want to decrease the crop area when increasing forest areas. so the cell area remaine same.
If increasing forest area exceed the cell size, then I'm going to reduce grass area to balance all.

And finally, I want to keep the last state land cover(2069) by 2200 and then save it into a NC file.
Also, keep all attributes the same as historical file.
