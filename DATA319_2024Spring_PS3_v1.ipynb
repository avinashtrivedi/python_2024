    "ANOVA compares means of two samples/populations, whereas MANOVA compares means of several samples/populations. MANOVA utilises the covariance-variance relationship to analyse several dependent variables simultaneously. The ANOVA test is used when there is just one dependent variable, and the number of independent factors may vary depending on the dataset. The MANOVA test is useful for analysing multiple dependent variables and assessing the influence of independent factors on these dependent variables in a dataset.\n",
